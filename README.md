CS1D College Touring Project

Students decide their desired college tour plan based off of four tour plans. To achieve this goal, a very readable and easy to use interfance must be implemented. 

### In-depth Description:
- In order to store the campus information (Campus name, campus souvenirs, distance between campus to campus) a connection to DB Browser's (SQLite) database must be developed
- To add and delete campus/souvenirs the SQL functions "INSERT INTO" and  "VALUES" are used
- Qt's push button's are used in order for the admin or student to navigate through the program
- To calculate the distance between campuses and total for souvenirs, recursion and basic arithmetic shall be implemented
